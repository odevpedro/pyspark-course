#Course Overview 
This course outlines the creation of a data pipeline in Python. It introduces a project structure involving three main components: ingestion, transformation, and persistence. The script establishes classes for each component, demonstrates class instantiation, and orchestrates the pipeline's execution. The goal is to gradually enhance functionality within each component using PySpark for data processing..
